# PatientStateDemo

This project is a simple demonstration of how to manage state in an Android application using **Jetpack Compose**. The app allows you to add patients to a dynamic list. A `TextField` is used to input the patient name, and a `Button` is used to add the patient to the list.

## Features

- Displays a list of patients.
- Allows adding a new patient to the list using a `TextField` and a button.
- The patient list is dynamically updated with each new patient added.

## Project Structure

- **MainActivity**: The main activity that manages the UI and the state of the patients.
- **PatientListScreen**: A composable that handles the screen displaying the list of patients and the form for adding a new patient.
- **PatientList**: A composable that displays the list of patients and the text field for entering a new patient name.

## Technologies Used

- **Jetpack Compose**: For building the UI declaratively.
- **Kotlin**: The programming language used to develop the app.
